# Auth Boilerplate with Passport-Local and Create-React-App Using JWT_SECRET
## Create-React-App Client

This is a boilerplate I created for myself. It is going to be used at the TVC meetup.

The goal was to have the client completely separate from the server. This created difficulties with using session/cookies to persist the login so I went with JSON web token solution.

The default port is 3000.

### What You'll Need

This was created with create-react-app to be used with the paired server.

From *client* folder, install the dependencies with `npm install` and then `npm start`. The client app should start automatically in a browser window.
